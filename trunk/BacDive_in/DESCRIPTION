Description: R client for the Application Programming Interface (API)
        of the BacDive database hosted at the Leibniz Institute DSMZ -
        German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. BacDive
        is the largest known database for standardised bacterial
        phenotypic information. Phenotypic data are mobilised from
        collections (e.g. CABI, CCUG, CIP, DSMZ) and enriched with data
        from published species descriptions. While the usage of the
        BacDive API requires registration, registration is free and
        easy to accomplish. The usage of the BacDive data is only
        permitted when in compliance with the BacDive terms and
        conditions (see the BacDive web page).

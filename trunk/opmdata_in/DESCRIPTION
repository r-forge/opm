Description: The package opm provides tools for analysing OmniLog(R)
        Phenotype Microarray (PM) data as produced by the device
        distributed by BIOLOG Inc. and similar kinds of data such as
        growth curves. The package opmdata contains the entire example
        data set from Vaas et al. (2012), which has been removed from
        opm due to its size, as well as additional example data sets
        added from time to time.

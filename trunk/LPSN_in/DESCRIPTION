Description: R client for the Application Programming Interface (API)
        of the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature
        (LPSN) hosted at the Leibniz Institute DSMZ - German Collection
        of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. LPSN provides
        comprehensive information on the nomenclature of prokaryotes.
        LPSN was founded by Jean P. Euzeby in 1997 and later on
        maintained by Aidan C. Parte. As of February 2020, LPSN is
        hosted and maintained at DSMZ, a non-for-profit biological
        resource centre and research institute. Note that the usage of
        the LPSN API requires registration (although registration is
        free and easy to accomplish) and that the usage of the LPSN
        data is only permitted when in compliance with the LPSN
        copyright (which is liberal, see the LPSN web page).
